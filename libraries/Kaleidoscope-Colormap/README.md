The `Colormap` extension provides an easier way to set up a different - static -
color map per-layer. This means that we can set up a map of colors for each key,
on a per-layer basis, and whenever a layer becomes active, the color map for
that layer is applied on top of everything else. Colors are picked from a
15-color palette (or 16, if we disable transparency), provided by
the [LED-Palette-Theme][plugin:l-p-t] plugin. The color map is stored in
`EEPROM`, and can be easily changed via the [Focus][plugin:focus] plugin, which
also provides palette editing capabilities.

## Using the extension

To use the extension, include the header, tell it the number of layers you have,
register the `Focus` hooks, and it will do the rest.

```c++
#include <Kaleidoscope.h>
#include <Kaleidoscope-Colormap.h>
#include <Kaleidoscope-Focus.h>

void setup(void) {
  USE_PLUGINS(&ColormapEffect, &Focus);

  Kaleidoscope.setup();
  
  ColormapEffect.max_layers(1);
  Focus.addHook(FOCUS_HOOK_LEDPALETTETHEME);
  Focus.addHook(FOCUS_HOOK_COLORMAP);
}
```

## Extension methods

The extension provides an `ColormapEffect` singleton object, with a single method:

### `.max_layers(max)`

> Tells the extension to reserve space in EEPROM for up to `max` layers. Can
> only be called once, any subsequent call will be a no-op.

## Focus commands

The plugin provides a single `Focus` hook, `FOCUS_HOOK_COLORMAP`, implementing
the following command:

### `colormap.map`

> Without arguments, prints the color map: palette indexes for all layers.
>
> With arguments, updates the color map with new indexes. One does not need to
> give the full map, the plugin will process as many arguments as available, and
> ignore anything past the last key on the last layer (as set by the
> `.max_layers()` method).
