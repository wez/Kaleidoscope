The `FingerPainter` plugin provides an elaborate `LED` mode, in which one's able
to paint with their fingers: when edit mode is toggled on, keys will - instead
of performing their normal function - cycle through the global palette - as
provided by the [LED-Palette-Theme][plugin:l-p-t] plugin -, one by one for each tap.

This allows us to edit the theme with the keyboard only, without any special
software (except to toggle edit mode on and off).

## Using the plugin

To use the plugin, just include the header, add it to the list of used plugins,
and register the `Focus` hooks:

```c++
#include <Kaleidoscope.h>
#include <Kaleidoscope-EEPROM-Settings.h>
#include <Kaleidoscope-FingerPainter.h>
#include <Kaleidoscope-Focus.h>

void setup() {
  USE_PLUGINS(&EEPROMSettings, &FingerPainter, &Focus);

  Kaleidoscope.setup();

  EEPROMSettings.seal();
  
  Focus.addHook(FOCUS_HOOK_FINGERPAINTER);
}
```

## Plugin methods

The plugin provides the `FingerPainter` object, which provides no public methods.

## Focus commands

The plugin provides a single `Focus` hook: `FOCUS_HOOK_FINGERPAINTER`, which
in turn provides the following commands:

### `fingerpainter.clear`

> Clears the canvas, so that one can start a new painting.

### `fingerpainter.toggle`

> Toggles the painting mode on and off.
