Bidirectional communication for Kaleidoscope. With this plugin, one can expose a
set of commands via the Serial port, and allow the host to talk with the
keyboard - and vice versa. This plugin implements only the basic building
blocks, a framework other plugins can opt-in to.

## Using the plugin

This plugin is **not** meant to be used by the end-user (apart from setting it
up to use plugin-provided hooks), but by plugin authors instead. As an end user,
please see the documentation of the plugins you use, for instructions on how to
hook them up with `Focus`!

Nevertheless, the basic commands we implement with this plugin alone, are usable
like this:

```c++
#include <Kaleidoscope.h>
#include <Kaleidoscope-Focus.h>

void setup () {
  Serial.begin (9600);

  USE_PLUGINS (&Focus);
  
  Kaleidoscope.setup ();

  Focus.addHook (FOCUS_HOOK_HELP);
  Focus.addHook (FOCUS_HOOK_VERSION);
}
```

## Plugin methods

The plugin provides the `Focus` object, which has the following method:

### `.addHook(FOCUS_HOOK (function, documentation))`

> Adds a new hook to `Focus`. Hooks are called in order of registration, and
> they get the parsed command name as argument. If they handle the command, they
> shall return `true`, otherwise `false`. Once a command has been handled, it
> will not be given to other hooks.
>
> The hook function is responsible for reading the rest of the command, in
> whatever way it sees fit.
>
> The `documentation` argument is a string, used by the `help` command, and can
> be left empty, if no documentation is desired for the `function`.

## Focus commands

The plugin ships with two (optional) hooks: `FOCUS_HOOK_VERSION`, and
`FOCUS_HOOK_HELP`, implementing the following two commands, respectively:

### `version`

> Return the version of the firmware, the keyboard vendor & product, and the
> compile date.

### `help`

> Return the list of commands the keyboard supports.
