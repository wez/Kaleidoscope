The `StalkerEffect` plugin provides an interesting new typing experience: the
LEDs light up as you tap keys, and play one of the selected effects: a haunting
trail of ghostly white lights, or a blazing trail of fire.

## Using the plugin

To use the plugin, one needs to include the header, and select the effect.

```c++
#include <Kaleidoscope.h>
#include <Kaleidoscope-LED-Stalker.h>

void setup (){
  USE_PLUGINS(&StalkerEffect);

  Kaleidoscope.setup();

  StalkerEffect.variant = STALKER(Haunt, (CRGB(0, 128, 0)));
  StalkerEffect.activate();
}
```

It is recommended to place the activation of the plugin (the `USE_PLUGINS` call)
as early as possible, so the plugin can catch all relevant key presses. The
configuration can happen at any time, but using the `STALKER` macro is highly
recommended.

## Plugin methods

The plugin provides the `StalkerEffect` object, which has the following
properties:

### `.variant`

> Set the effect to use with the plugin. See below for a list.
>
> It is recommended to use the `STALKER` macro to declare the effect itself.

### `.stepLength`

> The length - in milliseconds - of each step of the animation. An animation
> lasts 256 steps.
>
> Defaults to 50.

## Plugin helpers

### `STALKER(effect, params)`

> Returns an effect, to be used to assign a value the `.variant` property of the
> `StalkerEffect` object. Any arguments given to the macro, are also passed on
> to the effect. If the effect takes no arguments, use an empty `params` list.

## Plugin effects

The plugin provides the following effects:

### `Haunt([color])`

> A ghostly haunt effect, that trails the key taps with a ghostly white color
> (or any other color, if specified).

### `BlazingTrail()`

> A blazing trail of fire will follow our fingers!
